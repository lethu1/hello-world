# hello-world
This repository is intended for practicing the GitHub flow.
I’m Lethukuthula Buthelezi, but most people call me Lethu. I’m passionate about teaching, creativity, and lifelong learning. I love exploring new ideas, helping others grow, and combining my love for education with technology to make a difference. Outside of that, I enjoy writing, singing, cooking, and practicing yoga to stay balanced and inspired.
